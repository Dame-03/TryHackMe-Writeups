# Walking an Application

**Date Completed:** Sept 2025  
**Tools Used:** Browser Developer Tools (Elements, Console, Network, Sources, Application)

## Summary
Manually reviewed a web application using only the browserâ€™s developer tools. Practiced revealing hidden/disabled DOM, inspecting client-side code, analyzing HTTP requests/responses, and enumerating client storage (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage). Demonstrated how to validate hypotheses with Local Overrides and breakpoints, and captured reproducible, redacted evidence without external tools or scripts.

## Skills Learned / Improved
- Revealing hidden/disabled/ARIA-hidden content via Elements panel
- Inspecting and modifying `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and cookies
- Exporting and reviewing HAR files (requests, responses, headers)
- Using Local Overrides to test/bypass client-side checks safely
- Setting XHR/Fetch, DOM, and Event Listener breakpoints
- Console scripting for quick probing and state changes
- Redacting sensitive data and structuring evidence for reproducibility
