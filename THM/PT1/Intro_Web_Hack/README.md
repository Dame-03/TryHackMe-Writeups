# Intro to Web Hacking

**Summary:**  
This section covers practical web application security testing, focusing on identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities seen in modern applications. Upon completing this section, you will be able to plan and execute structured web assessments, capture reproducible evidence, and clearly communicate impact and remediation.
