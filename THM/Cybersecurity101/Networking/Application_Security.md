# Networking Application Protocols & Security

**Date Completed:** Aug 2025  
**Tools Used:** whois, nslookup, dig, web browser, ftp client, email client, OpenSSL, SSH client, VPN client

## Summary
This module covered key application layer protocols and their secure counterparts. Learned to use WHOIS for domain registration details, DNS for name resolution, HTTP and FTP for data access and transfer, and email protocols SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. Discussed securing plaintext protocols with SSL/TLS, enabling HTTPS and secure email transfer. Introduced SSH as a secure replacement for Telnet and explained how VPNs create encrypted tunnels over untrusted networks.

- Using WHOIS to gather domain ownership information
- Querying DNS records with nslookup or dig
- Differentiating between HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP
- Understanding SSL/TLS and its role in encrypting communications
- Securing plaintext protocols with encryption
