## Networking 
This section covers core networking concepts, protocols, and secure communication methods. Topics include the OSI model, IP addressing, routing, infrastructure protocols (DHCP, ARP, NAT, ICMP), application layer protocols (DNS, HTTP, FTP, email protocols), and securing network communications with SSL/TLS, SSH, and VPNs.

**Write-ups:**
