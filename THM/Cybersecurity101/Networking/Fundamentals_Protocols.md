# Networking Fundamentals & Core Protocols

**Date Completed:** Aug 2025  
**Tools Used:** netcat (nc), ping, traceroute, arp, ipconfig/ifconfig

## Summary
This module introduced foundational networking concepts and the key protocols that support communication between systems. Covered the ISO OSI network model, IP addressing, subnets, routing basics, and the differences between TCP and UDP. Explored infrastructure protocols such as DHCP for dynamic IP assignment, ARP for IP-to-MAC mapping, NAT for internet connectivity, and ICMP for diagnostics. Practiced using common troubleshooting tools including ping, traceroute, and netcat to connect to open TCP ports.

## Skills Learned / Improved
- Understanding the purpose and layers of the ISO OSI model
- Interpreting IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, and routing concepts
- Differentiating between TCP and UDP and their common port numbers
- Explaining DHCP, ARP, NAT, and ICMP functions
- Using ping and traceroute for network diagnostics
- Connecting to open TCP ports from the command line using netcat
