# Blue â€“ Windows Exploitation Basics

**Date Completed:** Aug 2025  
**Tools Used:** Nmap, Metasploit Framework

## Summary
This room provided a beginner-friendly introduction to exploiting a Windows machine through common misconfigurations. Covered scanning the target to identify open services and vulnerabilities, determining the appropriate exploit, and leveraging Metasploit to gain access. Emphasized that the machine does not respond to ICMP ping, requiring alternate host discovery methods, and is designed as an educational exercise rather than a boot2root CTF.

## Skills Learned / Improved
- Scanning Windows targets with Nmap for vulnerability identification
- Recognizing and exploiting common Windows misconfigurations
- Bypassing ICMP restrictions for host discovery
- Using Metasploit modules for exploitation
- Understanding basic post-exploitation steps on Windows
