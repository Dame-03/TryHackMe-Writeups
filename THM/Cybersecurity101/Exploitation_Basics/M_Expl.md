**Date Completed:** Aug 2025  
**Tools Used:** Metasploit Framework, msfvenom

## Summary
This room expanded on Metasploit usage with a focus on scanning, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation. Covered scanning target systems, leveraging the Metasploit database feature, conducting vulnerability scans, exploiting vulnerable services, and using msfvenom to generate payloads for obtaining a Meterpreter session on the target system.

## Skills Learned / Improved
- Scanning target systems using Metasploit modules
- Using the Metasploit database for storing and organizing scan results
- Performing vulnerability scans within Metasploit
- Exploiting vulnerable services with Metasploit
- Creating payloads with msfvenom to establish a Meterpreter session
