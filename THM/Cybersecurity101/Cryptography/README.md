## Cryptography
Covers symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms and the use of hashing algorithms in everyday systems.

**Write-ups:**
- [Cryptography Basics](C_Basics.md) – Learned key terms, basic ciphers, and foundational math concepts in cryptography.
- [Public Key](C_Public_Key.md) – Learned RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and applications like SSH, SSL/TLS, and PGP/GPG.
- [Hashing Basics](Hashing_Basics.md) – Learned hash functions, authentication roles, collision risks, and integrity protection.
