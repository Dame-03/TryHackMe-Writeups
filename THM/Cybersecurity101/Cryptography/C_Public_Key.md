# Public Key Cryptography

**Date Completed:** Aug 2025  
**Tools Used:** SSH client, OpenSSL, GPG

## Summary
This room introduced asymmetric cryptosystems and their real-world applications. Covered RSA and Diffie-Hellman algorithms, along with the use of public key cryptography in SSH for secure remote access, SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted web communications, and PGP/GPG for secure messaging and file encryption.

## Skills Learned / Improved
- Understanding the principles of asymmetric (public key) cryptography
- Recognizing the purpose and operation of RSA and Diffie-Hellman
- Using SSH for secure authentication and remote access
- Understanding SSL/TLS certificates and their role in web security
- Applying PGP/GPG for secure communication and file encryption
