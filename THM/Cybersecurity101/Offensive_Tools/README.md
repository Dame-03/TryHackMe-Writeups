## Offensive Security Tooling
This section explores three essential offensive security tools used in penetration testing. Each tool targets a different aspect of security testing: Hydra for password attacks, Gobuster for directory and page discovery, and SQLMap for exploiting vulnerable database systems. Together, they provide a strong foundation for web and network-based offensive operations.
