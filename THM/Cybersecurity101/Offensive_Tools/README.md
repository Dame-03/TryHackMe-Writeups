## Offensive Security Tooling
This section explores essential offensive security tools used in penetration testing. Each tool targets a different aspect of security testing: Hydra for password attacks, Gobuster for directory and page discovery, SQLMap for exploiting vulnerable databases, and shells for remote access in post-exploitation scenarios.

**Write-ups:**
- [Room: Hydra](Hydra.md) – Learned to brute-force web credentials using Hydra.
- [Room: Gobuster Basics](Gobuster.md) – Learned enumeration techniques for directories, subdomains, and virtual hosts.
- [Room: Shells Overview](Shells.md) – Learned reverse, bind, and web shell usage in offensive security.
- [Room: SQLMap Basics](SQLMap.md) – Explored automated SQL injection testing and database exploitation.
